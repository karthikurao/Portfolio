## üöÄ Running Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install

3.  **Set up Environment Variables :**
    * This project uses Formspree for the contact form. The endpoint URL is currently in `src/components/ContactSection.tsx`. For a more robust setup, you could move this to an environment variable (e.g., `.env.local`):
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_URL=[https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id](https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id)
        ```
        And then access it in the component via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_URL`.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
